# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In the original code, the logic was quite complex and difficult to follow. It had long conditional statements and mixed responsibilities, making it challenging to understand the flow of execution. To improve readability, I refactored the code by breaking down the logic into smaller, well-named functions. Each function now has a clear purpose and encapsulates a specific part of the functionality. This modular approach makes it easier to understand the code at a glance. I also added comments to provide additional clarity on the purpose of each function and variable. Additionally, I followed common JavaScript conventions, such as using camelCase for function and variable names, which makes the code more familiar and readable for JavaScript developers. These changes make the code more approachable, maintainable, and easier to comprehend, leading to better overall readability.
